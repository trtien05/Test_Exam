## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

The Task Management Application simplifies task organization by allowing users to easily create, read, and filter tasks. Built with React and Ant Design, it offers a user-friendly interface while ensuring code quality through validation, unit tests, and best practices.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **Frontend:**
  - **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Ant Design**: UI component library for fast development.
  - **Axios**: For making API requests.
  - **Styled-components**: For styling components.
- **Testing:**

  - **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework.

## <a name="features">🔋 Features</a>

👉 **Task Creation**: Add new tasks using an intuitive input form.

👉 **Task Display**: Fetch and display tasks from a mock API on initial load.

👉 **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by "All", "Completed", or "Incomplete".

👉 **Input Validation**: Prevent users from adding empty tasks.

👉 **Real-time Updates**: New tasks appear in the task list immediately upon creation.

👉 **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.

👉 **Component Development**: Showcase components in isolation with Storybook.

👉 **Code Quality Assurance**: Configured Prettier and ESLint for consistent code formatting and adherence to coding standards.

and many more, including code architecture and reusability.

## <a name="quick-start">🤸 Quick Start</a>

To quickly get started with the Task Management Application, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd exam-project

   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**  
   npm install

3. **In the project directory, you can run:**

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
